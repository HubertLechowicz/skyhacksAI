# How to

This project is our solution to AI Hackathon, SkyHackAI 2019. 

We've scored 2nd place at the bonus task, we are very happy about it.
We've scored 10th place at the main task, we are still very happy about bonus task.


Main task consisted of making an artificial inteligence to classify images and tag them corresponding to what objects are seen in the rooms (mostly furniture), then classify whole pictures as rooms, finally evaulate on 1-5 score  state of the room and wealth.

Bonus task, which we are proud of, was an Natural-Language-Processing (NLP) task. Based on the results of main task, housing brochure with human like text describing the corresponding pictures was to be made. 

Unfortunetly there was no prize money for bonus task, but hey third place is third place!
